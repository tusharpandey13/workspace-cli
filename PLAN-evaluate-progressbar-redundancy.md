# Implementation Plan: Evaluate ProgressBar.ts Redundancy

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Determine if `src/utils/progressBar.ts` is redundant given the existence of `src/utils/progressIndicator.ts`
- **Current State**: Two progress bar implementations exist:
  1. **Custom ProgressBar**: Simple, homegrown implementation using basic console output
  2. **ProgressIndicator**: Professional implementation using `cli-progress` library
- **Evidence Found**:
  - No imports of ProgressBar found anywhere in codebase
  - No test files testing ProgressBar functionality
  - ProgressIndicator is actively used throughout the codebase
  - Multiple PLAN files document the transition from custom to cli-progress solution
- **Root Cause**: ProgressBar appears to be legacy code that was replaced by ProgressIndicator

## PLAN

- [ ] Confirm no usage of ProgressBar in the codebase with comprehensive search
- [ ] Check if ProgressBar is referenced in any documentation or configuration
- [ ] Verify ProgressIndicator provides all functionality that ProgressBar had
- [ ] Document the redundancy findings
- [ ] Recommend removal if confirmed redundant

## NOTES

- ProgressIndicator uses cli-progress library (battle-tested, 4.9M weekly downloads)
- ProgressBar is a simpler custom implementation
- Multiple plan files show evolution from custom progress to cli-progress
- No imports or usage found suggests ProgressBar is dead code
