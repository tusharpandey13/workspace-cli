# Implementation Plan: Parallel Git Operations System (P0 - ROI: 8/10)

## ANALYZE

**Problem**: Git operations executed sequentially causing 60+ second workspace setup times when dealing with multiple repositories.

**Current State**:

- `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts` executes operations sequentially
- Repository cloning, fetching, and worktree creation done one after another
- Independent operations (main repo + samples repo) processed serially
- No parallelization of safe, independent git operations

**Target Performance**: Reduce workspace setup from 60+ seconds to <30 seconds (50% improvement)

**Affected Files**:

- `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts` (main git operations)
- `src/commands/init.ts` (workspace initialization)
- Related test files for git operations
- Error handling and logging infrastructure

**Dependencies**:

- Promise.all for concurrent operations
- Existing git command execution infrastructure
- Error handling for partial failures
- Progress reporting system

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Parallel Operation Architecture:

```typescript
interface GitOperationBatch {
  operations: GitOperation[];
  dependencies: string[];
  maxConcurrency: number;
}

class ParallelGitOperations {
  async executeBatches(batches: GitOperationBatch[]): Promise<BatchResults> {
    // Execute operations in dependency order with parallelization
  }

  async executeParallel(operations: GitOperation[]): Promise<OperationResult[]> {
    // Execute independent operations concurrently
  }
}
```

### Parallel Execution Strategy:

```typescript
// Batch 1: Independent repository operations (parallel)
const repositoryBatch = [
  () => ensureRepositoryExists(paths.sourceRepoPath, project.repo),
  () => ensureRepositoryExists(paths.destinationRepoPath, project.sample_repo),
];

// Batch 2: Dependent operations (sequential after batch 1)
const worktreeBatch = [
  () => addWorktree(paths.sourceRepoPath, paths.sourcePath, branchName),
  () => addWorktree(paths.destinationRepoPath, paths.destinationPath, samplesBranchName),
];
```

### Error Handling Strategy:

- Aggregate errors from parallel operations
- Provide detailed error context for each failed operation
- Continue with successful operations where possible
- Clean up partial failures automatically

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Performance Targets:

- **Workspace Setup Time**: Reduce from 60+ seconds to <30 seconds (50% improvement)
- **Repository Operations**: Main and sample repo operations in parallel
- **Network Efficiency**: Concurrent network operations where safe

### Quality Targets:

- No git repository corruption from concurrent operations
- Clear error messages for parallel operation failures
- Proper cleanup of partial failures
- Progress reporting works correctly for concurrent operations

### Safety Targets:

- No concurrent access issues with git repositories
- File locking handled appropriately
- Network resource usage remains reasonable
- Process doesn't overwhelm system resources

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

If parallelization causes issues:

1. Add `N_SEQUENTIAL_GIT_OPS` environment variable to disable parallelization
2. Keep original sequential execution as fallback
3. Gradual rollback by operation type if needed

## NOTES

### Architecture Decisions:

- **Promise.all batching**: Reliable and well-supported pattern
- **Dependency-based sequencing**: Ensures correctness while maximizing parallelism
- **Error aggregation**: Provides comprehensive failure information

### Safety Considerations:

- Git operations are generally safe to parallelize when working on different repositories
- Same repository operations must be carefully sequenced
- Network operations benefit most from parallelization
- File system operations need careful coordination

### Testing Strategy:

- Unit tests for parallel operation coordination
- Integration tests for real git operations
- Network failure simulation and recovery testing
- Performance benchmarking under various network conditions

This implementation provides significant performance improvements while maintaining the safety and reliability of git operations through careful analysis of operation dependencies and robust error handling.
