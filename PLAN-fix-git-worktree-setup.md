# Implementation Plan: Fix Git Worktree Setup

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Git worktree setup fails for branch names with slashes (bugfix/RT-same-scope-as-AT)
- **Affected Files**: `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts`, `src/utils/secureExecution.ts`, `package.json`
- **Risks**: Git command failures when branches don't exist locally or remotely, samples branch naming conflicts, sudo password prompts during development

## PLAN

- [x] Create new module `src/csv-generator.ts`.
- [x] Fix NPX sudo password prompts by migrating to pnpm equivalents in package.json
- [x] Implement conditional error logging in secureExecution.ts for expected git failures
- [x] Add samples branch name transformation (slash → dash conversion)
- [x] Update branch existence checking logic to handle local vs remote scenarios
- [x] Fix duplicate conditional blocks causing syntax errors
- [x] Create comprehensive test with real git repositories to validate all branch scenarios
- [x] Test full end-to-end: `space init next 2326 bugfix/RT-same-scope-as-AT` without dry-run
- [x] Validate samples branch transformation works correctly
- [x] **[LOW PRIORITY]** Run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` across modified files

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

✅ NPX → pnpm migration complete
✅ Conditional error logging implemented
✅ Samples branch naming transformation added
✅ Enhanced branch existence checking (local + remote)
✅ Fixed syntax errors in conditional logic
✅ **SUCCESSFUL END-TO-END VALIDATION**

## VALIDATION RESULTS

✅ **SUCCESS**: `space init next 2326 bugfix/RT-same-scope-as-AT` completed successfully
✅ **SUCCESS**: Workspace created at `/Users/tushar.pandey/src/workspaces/next/bugfix_RT-same-scope-as-AT/`
✅ **SUCCESS**: Main repository worktree created with branch `bugfix/RT-same-scope-as-AT`
✅ **SUCCESS**: Samples repository worktree created with transformed branch `bugfix-RT-same-scope-as-AT-samples`
✅ **SUCCESS**: Dry run mode works correctly for `feature/user/profile-update`

## NOTES

- Fixed duplicate `if (localBranchExists)` conditional blocks that caused compilation errors
- Branch checking now properly handles: branch exists locally, branch exists remotely but not locally, branch doesn't exist anywhere
- Samples branch transformation converts "bugfix/RT-same-scope-as-AT" → "bugfix-RT-same-scope-as-AT-samples"
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow
