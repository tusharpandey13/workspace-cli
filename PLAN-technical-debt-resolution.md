# Implementation Plan: Technical Debt Resolution

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: 11 failing unit tests representing technical debt from performance optimization implementation
- **Affected Files**: Test infrastructure, GitHub CLI integration, logger formatting, progress indicators, performance benchmarking
- **Risks**: Test instability, inconsistent CI/CD behavior, developer confusion
- **Dependencies**: External GitHub CLI, TTY detection, performance measurement infrastructure

## PLAN

### Phase 1: GitHub CLI Integration Test Fixes (Priority: HIGH)

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Fix dry run mode test in `test/context-data-github-cli.test.ts`
  - [ ] Issue: `should skip GitHub CLI check in dry run mode` - expected 1 result but got 0
  - [ ] Root cause: Dry run mode not properly returning mock data
  - [ ] Solution: Update mock behavior to return expected data structure in dry run mode

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Fix GitHub CLI validation timeout parameter in `test/early-validation.test.ts`
  - [ ] Issue: `should validate single issue ID successfully` - unexpected timeout parameter in spy call
  - [ ] Root cause: Test expects specific execa call signature but code includes timeout option
  - [ ] Solution: Update test expectation to include timeout parameter

### Phase 2: Logger Icon Formatting Fix (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Fix logger icon formatting test in `test/logger.test.ts`
  - [ ] Issue: `should format messages with appropriate icons` - icons not found in console output
  - [ ] Root cause: Logger may not be outputting icons in test environment or assertion logic incorrect
  - [ ] Solution: Debug logger output and fix icon assertion logic

### Phase 3: Progress Indicator State Management (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Fix progress indicator state management in `test/progress-indicator.test.ts`
  - [ ] Issue: 4 tests failing related to `isActive()` state management
  - [ ] Root cause: Progress indicator not properly updating active state in test environment
  - [ ] Solution: Fix state management logic and test environment compatibility

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Investigate TTY detection impact on progress tests
  - [ ] Test environment may not properly simulate TTY behavior
  - [ ] Ensure progress indicators work correctly in both TTY and non-TTY environments

### Phase 4: Performance Test Calibration (Priority: LOW)

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Calibrate performance test targets for test environment
  - [ ] Issue: Startup time 213ms vs 150ms target (still better than 200ms baseline)
  - [ ] Issue: Config loading performance varies in test conditions
  - [ ] Solution: Adjust targets for test environment or improve measurement reliability

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Improve performance test stability
  - [ ] Add warmup runs to reduce measurement variance
  - [ ] Consider using median instead of single measurement
  - [ ] Add tolerance ranges for test environment variations

### Phase 5: Test Infrastructure Improvements (Priority: LOW)

- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Add test environment detection and adaptation
  - [ ] Detect CI vs local test environments
  - [ ] Adjust test behavior and expectations accordingly
  - [ ] Document test environment requirements

- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Improve test cleanup and isolation
  - [ ] Ensure all tests properly clean up resources
  - [ ] Prevent test interference and state leakage
  - [ ] Add comprehensive teardown procedures

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

### **Quality Targets**:

- **Unit Test Pass Rate**: Target 100% (405/405 tests passing)
- **Test Stability**: All tests should pass consistently across environments
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Tests should be reliable in automated environments
- **Developer Experience**: Clear test failure messages and easy debugging

### **Success Metrics**:

- All 11 failing tests resolved and passing
- No regression in existing functionality
- Improved test reliability and maintainability
- Clear documentation of test environment requirements

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

- Each test fix is isolated and can be reverted independently
- No impact on production code functionality
- Test infrastructure changes are additive and backwards compatible
- Clear commit history for easy reversion if needed

## NOTES

### **Priority Rationale**:

- **HIGH**: GitHub CLI integration affects core functionality testing
- **MEDIUM**: Logger and progress indicator tests affect developer experience
- **LOW**: Performance tests are functional but need calibration for consistency

### **Implementation Approach**:

- Fix tests one by one to avoid introducing new issues
- Maintain existing functionality while improving test reliability
- Focus on root cause fixes rather than assertion adjustments
- Document test environment assumptions and requirements
