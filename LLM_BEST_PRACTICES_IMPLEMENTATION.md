# LLM Best Practices Implementation

Based on [antirez's recommendations](https://antirez.com/news/154) for working with LLMs effectively, this document outlines the improvements made to the workspace CLI prompts and logic.

## Key Recommendations Applied

### 1. **Provide Large Context**
✅ **Enhanced all prompt templates with comprehensive technical context:**

- **Added technical context sections** explaining NextJS Auth0 SDK architecture, session management, middleware patterns
- **Included anti-patterns to avoid** with explicit warnings about common mistakes
- **Added preferred solution patterns** with concrete examples of best practices
- **Provided debugging guidance** with structured approaches to troubleshooting

### 2. **Refuse "Vibe Coding" - Human Stays in Control**
✅ **Emphasized human oversight throughout all processes:**

- **Analysis prompt**: Added "⚠️ CRITICAL: You are the human in control - LLM provides code, you verify and execute manually"
- **Fix-and-test prompt**: Added "⚠️ YOU ARE IN CONTROL: LLM provides suggestions, you make all decisions and execute manually"
- **Testing prompt**: Added "⚠️ Human Control: You write and execute tests manually - LLM provides suggestions only"
- **Review prompt**: Added "⚠️ Human Control: You are conducting the review - LLM provides analysis, you make all judgments"

### 3. **Manual Verification Points**
✅ **Added explicit human verification checkpoints:**

- **Build verification**: "Check build output for errors/warnings before proceeding"
- **Test validation**: "Manually review test results for false positives/negatives"
- **Code review**: "Manually review all generated code before implementation"
- **Test execution**: "Review generated test logic before execution"

### 4. **Updated Submit Command - Human-Supervised Flow**
✅ **Transformed automated submission into guided, human-controlled process:**

**Before**: Fully automated git add, commit, push, and PR creation
**After**: Human-supervised workflow with manual approval at each step:

1. **Show diff for review** - Human sees all changes before proceeding
2. **Prompt for staging approval** - Manual confirmation before `git add`
3. **Show staged changes** - Review what will be committed
4. **Custom commit message** - Human writes or approves commit message
5. **Manual push/PR commands** - Provides commands for human to execute

This aligns with antirez's principle: *"You want to always be part of the loop by moving code by hand"*

## Technical Context Improvements

### Auth0 NextJS SDK Patterns Added
- Session management best practices
- Middleware execution patterns
- Error boundary implementation
- Type safety requirements
- Configuration validation approaches

### Anti-Patterns Documentation
- ❌ Manual cookie manipulation
- ❌ Client-side secret exposure  
- ❌ Synchronous auth checks
- ❌ Missing error boundaries
- ❌ Hardcoded redirects
- ❌ Race conditions

### Preferred Patterns
- ✅ Defensive programming
- ✅ Immutable updates
- ✅ Proper error propagation
- ✅ Consistent logging
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Builder patterns for complex objects

## Testing Guidelines Enhanced

### Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- ❌ Flaky time-dependent tests
- ❌ Over-mocking that makes tests meaningless
- ❌ Missing edge case coverage

### Preferred Testing Approaches  
- ✅ HTTP-layer mocking (`msw`, `nock`)
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Setup/teardown for consistency
- ✅ Error scenario testing

## Philosophy Alignment

The updates align with antirez's core philosophy:

> *"The maximum quality of work is reached using the human+LLM equation... the ability to communicate efficiently is a key factor in using LLMs"*

**Key Principles Implemented:**

1. **Human maintains control** - All critical decisions require human approval
2. **LLM as amplifier, not replacement** - Provides suggestions and context, human makes decisions  
3. **Large context provision** - Comprehensive technical background and patterns
4. **Explicit anti-pattern warnings** - Help humans avoid common mistakes
5. **Manual verification loops** - Human validates each step before proceeding

## Impact

These changes transform the CLI from an automation tool into a **human-LLM collaboration platform** that:

- Provides rich context for better LLM responses
- Maintains human control over all critical operations
- Reduces the risk of "vibe coding" mistakes
- Ensures human learning and understanding of all code changes
- Follows enterprise-grade development practices

The result is higher quality code, better human understanding of changes, and reduced risk of introducing bugs through automated processes.
