# Implementation Plan: README Placeholder Content

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: The README.md file contains two placeholder comments that need to be filled with actual content:
  1. `// make a table here of supported repos and example repos` - Should show compatibility matrix of pre-configured auth0 repos
  2. `// add a sample directory tree here of an example usecase for high-level inference` - Should show example workspace structure

- **Affected Files**: `/Users/tushar.pandey/src/workspace-cli/README.md`
- **Context**: Based on config.yaml analysis, there are 15+ pre-configured auth0 repos across different tech stacks
- **Workspace Structure**: From code analysis, workspaces contain both main repo and sample repo subdirectories

## PLAN

- [x] Create compatibility matrix table showing supported repositories and their categories (Web, Mobile, Server, CLI)
- [x] Add sample directory tree showing the result of running `space init auth0-spa-js feat/something`
- [x] Replace first placeholder with the compatibility matrix table
- [x] Replace second placeholder with the directory tree example
- [x] Verify markdown formatting is correct

## NOTES

- The compatibility matrix should group repos by technology (Web: React, Angular, Vue, Next.js; Server: Node, Java, Go, etc.)
- The directory tree should show the workspace structure with both main repo and sample repo
- Based on config.yaml, the workspace structure follows pattern: `~/src/workspaces/{project}/{branch}/{repo-name}/`
