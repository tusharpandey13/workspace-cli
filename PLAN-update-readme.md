# Implementation Plan: Update README.md with Comprehensive Documentation

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: README.md is outdated and lacks comprehensive documentation after DOCS.md was deleted
- **Current State**: Basic usage information, but missing detailed documentation about features, configuration, and workflows
- **Requirements**: Start simple, gradually include complex topics, maintain nice flow
- **Affected Files**: `README.md`
- **References**:
  - Package.json for correct CLI name and description
  - Config.yaml for configuration examples
  - Help files for command examples
  - Commands directory for available functionality

## PLAN

- [ ] **BASIC SETUP**: Update header section with correct project description and branding
- [ ] **INSTALLATION**: Improve installation section with pnpm preference (per copilot instructions)
- [ ] **QUICK START**: Add a simple getting started section for new users
- [ ] **CORE CONCEPTS**: Explain what workspaces and worktrees are and why they're useful
- [ ] **BASIC COMMANDS**: Document the main commands (init, list, projects, info, clean)
- [ ] **CONFIGURATION**: Explain config.yaml structure and project setup
- [ ] **ADVANCED FEATURES**: Cover PR workflows, environment files, post-init scripts
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOWS**: Show common development patterns and use cases
- [ ] **TROUBLESHOOTING**: Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING**: Link to contributing guide
- [ ] **APPENDIX**: Prerequisites, compatibility, and additional resources
- [ ] **[FORMATTING]** Format markdown with proper headings and code blocks
- [ ] **[VALIDATION]** Ensure all commands and examples are accurate

## NOTES

- Follow the existing style but expand significantly
- Use the galaxy icon that's already there
- Include proper badges and status indicators
- Reference actual file contents for accuracy
- Start with simple concepts and build up complexity
- Include realistic examples using the configured projects
