# Implementation Plan: Phase 3 - Parallel Git Operations System

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Git operations executed sequentially causing 60+ second workspace setup times when dealing with multiple repositories
- **Current State**: `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts` executes all operations sequentially (clone → validate → freshness → branch fetch → worktree creation)
- **Target Performance**: Reduce workspace setup from 60+ seconds to <30 seconds (50% improvement)
- **Affected Files**: `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts`, `src/utils/parallelGit.ts` (new), test files
- **Risks**: Git repository corruption, concurrent access issues, partial failure scenarios
- **Dependencies**: Existing git infrastructure, Promise.all coordination, proper error handling

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### ParallelGitOperations Architecture:

```typescript
interface GitOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'clone' | 'validate' | 'freshness' | 'branch' | 'worktree';
  repoPath: string;
  params: any;
  execute: () => Promise<any>;
}

interface GitOperationBatch {
  operations: GitOperation[];
  dependencies: string[];
  maxConcurrency: number;
}

class ParallelGitOperations {
  async executeParallel(operations: GitOperation[]): Promise<OperationResult[]> {
    // Execute independent operations concurrently with Promise.all
  }

  async executeBatches(batches: GitOperationBatch[]): Promise<BatchResults> {
    // Execute operations in dependency order with parallelization
  }

  async parallelRepositorySetup(mainRepo: string, sampleRepo?: string): Promise<void> {
    // Clone, validate, and refresh repositories in parallel
  }
}
```

### Parallelization Strategy:

1. **Batch 1 (Parallel)**: Repository cloning (main + sample repos)
2. **Batch 2 (Parallel)**: Repository validation + freshness (main + sample repos)
3. **Batch 3 (Parallel)**: Default branch fetching (main + sample repos)
4. **Batch 4 (Parallel)**: Worktree creation (main + sample repos)

### Safety Mechanisms:

- Different repositories can be operated on concurrently (git safety confirmed)
- Repository integrity validation after all operations
- Proper error aggregation and rollback on failures
- File locking and resource management
- Sequential fallback via environment variable

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Performance Targets:

- **Workspace Setup Time**: 60+ seconds → <30 seconds (50% improvement)
- **Repository Operations**: Main and sample repo operations in parallel
- **Network Efficiency**: Concurrent network operations where safe
- **Resource Usage**: Reasonable system resource consumption

### Safety Targets:

- **Zero Repository Corruption**: All git operations maintain integrity
- **Proper Error Handling**: Clear error messages for parallel operation failures
- **Clean Failure Recovery**: Proper cleanup of partial failures
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

### Quality Targets:

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Comprehensive `test/parallel-git-operations.test.ts`
- **E2E Test Coverage**: 5+ new scenarios in test matrix
- **Performance Validation**: Automated benchmarking confirms targets
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

If parallelization causes issues:

1. **Environment Variable**: `SEQUENTIAL_GIT_OPS=true` disables parallel operations
2. **Gradual Rollback**: Can disable by operation type if needed
3. **Full Fallback**: Original sequential execution preserved as default
4. **Safe Deployment**: Feature flag controlled rollout

## NOTES

- Git operations on different repositories are safe to parallelize (confirmed by git documentation)
- Operations on the same repository require careful sequencing (maintained in design)
- Network operations (clone, fetch) show highest parallelization benefits
- I/O operations (validate, branch metadata) also benefit from parallelization
- Error aggregation preserves all error context for debugging
