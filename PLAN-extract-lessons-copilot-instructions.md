# Implementation Plan: Extract Lessons Learned for Copilot Instructions

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Need to extract valuable lessons from comprehensive performance optimization work and integrate into copilot instructions
- **Source Materials**: Multiple insight documents from docs/knowledge-base/ containing implementation patterns, performance achievements, technical debt, and architectural decisions
- **Target**: Update .github/copilot-instructions.md with concise, actionable lessons learned
- **Constraints**: Keep updates short as requested by user

## PLAN

- [ ] Complete analysis of remaining insight documents for comprehensive understanding
- [ ] Extract key lessons learned across categories:
  - Performance optimization patterns (caching, lazy loading)
  - Testing methodologies and realistic target setting
  - Package-based vs custom implementation decisions
  - Technical debt management approaches
  - Problem resolution patterns
- [ ] Identify actionable patterns that will guide future development
- [ ] Draft concise additions to copilot-instructions.md focusing on:
  - Performance optimization lessons
  - Testing calibration insights
  - Architecture decision patterns
  - Technical debt awareness
- [ ] Review current copilot-instructions.md structure to identify best integration points
- [ ] Update copilot-instructions.md with extracted lessons while maintaining existing format
- [ ] Validate that updates remain concise and actionable as requested

## NOTES

- Focus on patterns that will prevent future issues and guide better decisions
- Prioritize performance-related lessons since that was the major work completed
- Include testing calibration insights to prevent overly aggressive targets
- Keep technical debt awareness without being overly detailed
- Maintain the existing copilot instructions structure and tone
