# Implementation Plan: Fix E2E Progress Issues

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: E2E tests failing due to progress indicator mismatch and inconsistent silent mode handling
- **Affected Files**: `src/commands/init.ts`, `src/utils/progressIndicator.ts`
- **Risks**: Must preserve init command output exactly as users expect it

## PLAN

- [ ] Fix progress indicator conditional logic mismatch in `src/commands/init.ts`
- [ ] Replace hardcoded `isSilent: true` with proper `isNonInteractive()` calculation
- [ ] Ensure `completeStep()` calls are conditional to match `startStep()` calls
- [ ] Add safety checks in `progressIndicator.ts` to handle uninitialized state gracefully
- [ ] Validate that init command output remains unchanged for interactive users
- [ ] Run E2E tests to verify fixes work
- [ ] **[LOW PRIORITY]** Run `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` across modified files

## NOTES

- Must not change any user-facing output
- Focus on internal consistency between progress initialization and usage
- E2E tests should pass without "Progress step not found" warnings
