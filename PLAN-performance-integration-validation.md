# Implementation Plan: Performance Integration Validation

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Need to validate all performance optimizations work together after progress bar fixes
- **Current Status**: Phases 1-4 completed, Phase 5 integration validation needed
- **Affected Files**: All performance systems (config caching, lazy loading, parallel git, progress indicators)
- **Risks**: Performance regressions from recent progress fixes, integration conflicts

## PLAN

### Phase 5.1: Create Integration Test Suite

- [ ] Create `test/performance/integration-tests.ts`
- [ ] Test combined optimizations scenario: config caching + lazy loading + parallel git
- [ ] Validate memory usage doesn't compound across optimizations
- [ ] Test startup time with all optimizations enabled
- [ ] Verify no interference between caching and lazy loading

### Phase 5.2: Performance Benchmarking Suite

- [ ] Create `test/performance/benchmark-suite.ts`
- [ ] Implement automated startup time measurement
- [ ] Implement memory usage tracking during full workflow
- [ ] Implement workspace initialization timing
- [ ] Create baseline vs optimized comparison

### Phase 5.3: Run E2E Validation

- [ ] Execute full E2E test suite (40 tests)
- [ ] Verify no regressions from progress bar fixes
- [ ] Test performance under different scenarios (TTY/non-TTY, existing/new workspaces)
- [ ] Validate cleanup step integration doesn't impact performance

### Phase 5.4: Knowledge Documentation

- [ ] Document integration insights in knowledge base
- [ ] Create performance metrics report
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guides

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All E2E tests pass (target: 40/40)
- Startup time remains <50ms
- Memory usage remains <5MB
- No performance regressions detected
- Integration patterns documented

## NOTES

- Focus on ensuring recent progress fixes don't compromise performance gains
- Test realistic usage scenarios, not just synthetic benchmarks
- Document any trade-offs discovered during integration testing
