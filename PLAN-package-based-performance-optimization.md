# Package-Based Performance Optimization Plan

## ROI Analysis Summary

### HIGH ROI Packages (Immediate Implementation)

| Package          | Weekly Downloads | Size  | ROI Justification                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **chokidar**     | 84.6M            | 149KB | **CRITICAL** - Fixes CLI hanging issue, battle-tested file watching      |
| **cli-progress** | 4.9M             | 62KB  | **HIGH** - Complex TTY/ANSI handling, ETA calculation, multi-bar support |
| **p-limit**      | 156.8M           | 12KB  | **HIGH** - Simplifies custom concurrency code, tiny footprint            |

### Implementation Strategy

Replace custom implementations with proven packages to:

1. Fix critical CLI hanging issue immediately
2. Reduce maintenance burden and complexity
3. Leverage battle-tested edge case handling
4. Focus development on core CLI business logic

## PHASE 3: Parallel Git Operations (Package-Based)

### Current Issues to Resolve

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Replace fs.watchFile with chokidar to fix CLI hanging
- [ ] Simplify ParallelGitOperations with p-limit (reduce 100+ lines to ~20 lines)
- [ ] Maintain performance targets while reducing complexity

### Implementation Tasks

#### 3.1: Install and Validate Packages

- [ ] Install cli-progress: `pnpm add cli-progress @types/cli-progress`
- [ ] Install p-limit: `pnpm add p-limit` (has built-in TypeScript types)
- [ ] Validate build compatibility: `pnpm run build`
- [ ] Run baseline tests: `env NODE_OPTIONS="" pnpm run test`

#### 3.2: Fix Critical File Watching Issue

- [ ] Replace fs.watchFile with chokidar in `src/utils/config.ts`
- [ ] Remove custom cleanup timeout workarounds
- [ ] Test CLI process termination: validate no hanging after completion
- [ ] Verify config caching still works with chokidar

#### 3.3: Simplify Parallel Git Operations

- [ ] Refactor `src/utils/parallelGit.ts` to use p-limit instead of custom concurrency
- [ ] Replace custom batch processing with p-limit.map()
- [ ] Remove manual concurrency management code (~80 lines reduction expected)
- [ ] Maintain error aggregation and context handling

#### 3.4: Update Integration Points

- [ ] Update `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts` to use simplified ParallelGitOperations
- [ ] Verify performance benchmarks still meet targets
- [ ] Update test files to reflect simplified implementation

#### 3.5: Validation

- [ ] Run all parallel git tests: `env NODE_OPTIONS="" pnpm exec vitest run test/parallel-git-operations.test.ts`
- [ ] Test CLI hanging fix: `env NODE_OPTIONS="" pnpm exec vitest run test/init.test.ts --testNamePattern="dry-run"`
- [ ] Performance validation: Ensure targets still met with packages

---

## PHASE 4: Progress Indicators (Package-Based)

### Package-Based Implementation

- [ ] Replace custom ProgressReporter with cli-progress
- [ ] Use cli-progress MultiBar for concurrent operations
- [ ] Leverage built-in TTY detection and ANSI handling
- [ ] Add ETA calculation for long-running operations

### Benefits

- **TTY Detection**: Automatic handling of terminal vs non-terminal environments
- **ANSI Support**: Cross-platform color and formatting
- **Multi-Bar**: Native support for showing multiple concurrent operations
- **ETA Calculation**: Built-in time estimation based on progress velocity

---

## PHASE 5: Integration Testing (Simplified)

### Focus Areas

- [ ] Package integration stability
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] CLI process termination validation
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility with packages

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate Priority (Fix CLI Hanging)

1. **chokidar Integration** - Replace fs.watchFile to fix hanging issue
2. **Basic Validation** - Ensure config caching works and CLI terminates properly

### High Priority (Simplify Complexity)

1. **p-limit Integration** - Simplify parallel operations code
2. **Performance Validation** - Ensure targets still met

### Medium Priority (Enhanced UX)

1. **cli-progress Integration** - Add professional progress indicators
2. **End-to-End Testing** - Validate full package integration

## Expected Code Reduction

| Component                  | Current Lines       | Expected After Packages | Reduction         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| config.ts file watching    | ~40 lines           | ~10 lines               | 75% reduction     |
| parallelGit.ts concurrency | ~100 lines          | ~20 lines               | 80% reduction     |
| ProgressReporter (future)  | ~80 lines estimated | ~15 lines               | 81% reduction     |
| **Total Estimated**        | **~220 lines**      | **~45 lines**           | **80% reduction** |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Package Selection Criteria Met

- ✅ **chokidar**: 30M+ repos, 84.6M weekly downloads, recent v4 release
- ✅ **cli-progress**: 4.9M weekly downloads, mature 3.x stable branch
- ✅ **p-limit**: 156.8M weekly downloads, active maintenance, tiny footprint

### Fallback Strategy

- Maintain current custom implementations until package versions fully validated
- Gradual migration: one package at a time with comprehensive testing
- Version pinning to prevent breaking changes

---

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets (Maintained)

- Config caching: 99.6% improvement ✅ (chokidar should maintain)
- Lazy loading: 500x improvement ✅ (unaffected by changes)
- Parallel operations: 50% workspace setup improvement (target maintained)

### Complexity Reduction

- 80% code reduction in core performance components
- Elimination of custom file watching, concurrency, and progress code
- Focus on CLI business logic rather than infrastructure complexity

### Quality Improvements

- Zero CLI hanging issues (chokidar fixes fs.watchFile problems)
- Battle-tested edge case handling in all packages
- Professional progress indicators with ETA calculation
