# Implementation Plan: Revise AI Capabilities Section for PM Audience

## ANALYZE

**Problems Identified**:

1. Too technical/engineer-focused language (needs PM-level messaging)
2. Claude mentions need removal
3. Emojis need removal
4. Template names are outdated - actual templates are: `analysis.prompt.md`, `fix-and-test.prompt.md`, `review-changes.prompt.md`, `PR_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md`
5. Sample App Integration section is inaccurate and should be removed
6. Security-First Validation System section is not needed
7. Conditional template selection is verified as accurate (based on sample_repo and GitHub context)
8. Descriptions are too long and technical

**Target Audience**: Product Managers (less technical, more business/outcome focused)

## PLAN

- [ ] Remove all Claude references
- [ ] Remove all emojis
- [ ] Remove "Security-First Validation System" section entirely
- [ ] Remove "Sample App Integration" section entirely
- [ ] Update template descriptions to reflect actual templates (4 templates, not 6)
- [ ] Rewrite descriptions for PM audience (focus on outcomes, not implementation)
- [ ] Make descriptions more concise and marketing-focused
- [ ] Keep "Conditional template selection" as it's verified accurate
- [ ] Maintain structure but simplify language

**New Structure**:

1. **Context Intelligence & Auto-Fetching** (simplified for PMs)
2. **Structured Development Templates** (4 actual templates, PM-friendly descriptions)
3. **Intelligent Automation** (keep existing + template selection)

## NOTES

- Focus on business value and outcomes rather than technical implementation
- Use language that PMs would understand and find compelling
- Keep it concise but still informative
- Maintain accuracy about what actually exists in the codebase
