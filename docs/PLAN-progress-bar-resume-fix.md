# Implementation Plan: Progress Bar Resume Fix

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Progress bar disappears when user chooses not to overwrite existing workspace
- **Root Cause**: `progressIndicator.pause()` clears the line but `resume()` is never called in the "no" branch
- **Affected Files**: `src/commands/init.ts` - `handleExistingWorkspace` function around line 454
- **Risk**: Low - simple addition of missing resume() call

## PLAN

- [x] Add proper progress bar initialization based on user choice
- [x] Fix progress step synchronization when user chooses not to overwrite workspace
- [x] Test both "yes" and "no" scenarios to verify fix works
- [x] **[COMPLETED]** Run linting and fix formatting issues

## NOTES

- The fix required restructuring progress bar initialization to happen after user input
- Progress steps are now synchronized with actual workflow steps
- No breaking changes or complex logic needed
