# Implementation Plan: Progress Indicators System (P1 - ROI: 7/10)

## ANALYZE

**Problem**: Long-running operations (>2 seconds) provide no user feedback, creating poor user experience and perception of tool being "stuck."

**Current State**:

- No progress indicators for git operations, workspace setup, or file operations
- Users have no visibility into what operations are being performed
- Long operations appear to hang without feedback
- Dry-run mode provides some logging but lacks progress context

**Target Performance**: Improve perceived performance by 30% through progress feedback

**Affected Files**:

- `src/commands/init.ts` (workspace initialization)
- `src/services/gitWorktrees.ts` (git operations)
- `src/utils/` (new progress utilities)
- Related command modules with long-running operations

**Dependencies**:

- CLI progress bar library (cli-progress or similar)
- Existing logger infrastructure
- Current operation sequencing and error handling

## PLAN

### Phase 1: Progress Infrastructure (2-3 days)

  - `--silent` flag completely suppresses progress output
  - `--verbose` and `--debug` modes enhance progress information
  - `--no-config` mode works with progress indicators

### **[OPTIONAL - LOW PRIORITY]** Enhancement tasks:

- [ ] Add progress persistence for resumable operations
- [ ] Implement progress analytics and timing data
- [ ] Add customizable progress themes and styling

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Progress Reporter Architecture:

```typescript
interface ProgressStage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: ProgressStep[];
  estimated: number; // milliseconds
}

interface ProgressStep {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  weight: number; // relative weight for progress calculation
}

class ProgressReporter {
  private currentStage?: ProgressStage;
  private currentStep?: ProgressStep;
  private progressBar: ProgressBar;

  startStage(stage: ProgressStage): void;
  updateStep(stepId: string, progress?: number): void;
  completeStage(): void;
}
```

### Progress Integration Example:

```typescript
const progressReporter = new ProgressReporter();
progressReporter.startStage({
  id: 'workspace-init',
  name: 'Initializing Workspace',
  steps: [
    { id: 'directories', description: 'Creating directories', weight: 1 },
    { id: 'git-setup', description: 'Setting up git worktrees', weight: 4 },
    { id: 'templates', description: 'Generating templates', weight: 2 },
    { id: 'post-init', description: 'Running post-init', weight: 1 },
  ],
  estimated: 30000, // 30 seconds estimated
});
```

### Progress Templates:

- **Workspace Initialization**: Multi-stage with git operations emphasis
- **Git Operations**: Focus on repository and network operations
- **File Operations**: Simple progress for file generation
- **Background Tasks**: Spinner for indeterminate operations

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

### User Experience Targets:

- **Perceived Performance**: 30% improvement in user satisfaction with long operations
- **Operation Visibility**: Clear indication of progress for operations >2 seconds
- **Error Context**: Progress state maintained and shown on failures

### Technical Targets:

- **Performance Overhead**: <5% increase in operation time from progress reporting
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint for progress tracking
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Works correctly in major terminal environments

### Quality Targets:

- Progress accuracy within 10% of actual completion
- No interference with existing logging and output
- Proper cleanup of progress indicators on completion/failure

## ROLLBACK STRATEGY

If progress indicators cause issues:

1. Add `N_DISABLE_PROGRESS` environment variable to disable progress
2. Graceful fallback to current logging-only behavior
3. Independent disable of specific progress types if needed

## NOTES

### Architecture Decisions:

- **CLI-based progress bars**: Appropriate for CLI tool, widely supported
- **Stage-based progress**: Matches natural operation breakdown
- **Integration with logger**: Maintains consistency with existing output

### User Experience Considerations:

- Progress should feel responsive and accurate
- Error states should preserve progress context
- Silent mode must be respected completely
- CI/CD environments need special handling

### Testing Strategy:

- Unit tests for progress calculation logic
- Integration tests with actual long-running operations
- Terminal compatibility testing across platforms
- Performance impact measurement and optimization

This implementation significantly improves user experience during long-running operations while maintaining the tool's reliability and performance characteristics.
