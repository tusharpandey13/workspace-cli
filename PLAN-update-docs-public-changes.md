# Implementation Plan: Update Documentation with Public Changes

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Need to update documentation with public-facing changes from the complete conversation history
- **Key Changes Identified**:
  - Performance optimization roadmap completed (99.6% startup improvement, 500x lazy loading improvement)
  - Test infrastructure improvements and calibration fixes
  - ProgressBar redundancy evaluation and cleanup
  - Configuration caching system implementation
  - Lazy module loading system implementation
- **Documentation Files to Check**: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, any performance-related docs
- **Focus**: Public-facing changes that users would benefit from knowing about

## PLAN

- [ ] Review existing README.md for performance claims and outdated information
- [ ] Check CHANGELOG.md for recent entries and add performance improvements
- [ ] Review CONTRIBUTING.md for any development process updates needed
- [ ] Check if there are user-facing performance improvements to document
- [ ] Update any performance benchmarks or claims in public documentation
- [ ] Document the completed performance roadmap achievements
- [ ] Add any new environment variables or configuration options introduced
- [ ] Ensure documentation reflects current test infrastructure capabilities

## NOTES

- Focus on user-visible improvements (startup time, memory usage)
- Include new environment variables like WORKSPACE_DISABLE_CACHE, WORKSPACE_DISABLE_LAZY
- Document the professional progress indicators improvement
- Avoid internal implementation details, focus on benefits to users
