# Implementation Plan: Auto-Approve All Terminal Commands

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: User wants to enable auto-approval for all terminal commands in VS Code
- **Domain Context**: VS Code settings.json configuration for chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove
- **Current State**: Specific commands and patterns are configured with individual true/false values
- **Target State**: All commands should be auto-approved without prompts
- **Affected Files**: `vscode-userdata:/Users/tushar.pandey/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`
- **Risks**: This will auto-approve ALL commands including potentially destructive ones
- **Self-Doubt Check**: This is a straightforward configuration change - no domain assumptions needed

## PLAN

- [ ] **APPROACH RESEARCH**: Determine the best way to configure catch-all auto-approval in VS Code settings
- [ ] Add a catch-all pattern `"*": true` or similar to auto-approve all commands
- [ ] Alternatively, replace the entire `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` section with a simple `true` value
- [ ] **PROBLEM VALIDATION**: Verify the change enables auto-approval for all terminal commands

## DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS

- None identified - this is a configuration change only

## NOTES

- This will bypass all safety prompts for terminal commands
- User explicitly requested this behavior
- The change affects VS Code's chat tools terminal auto-approval feature
