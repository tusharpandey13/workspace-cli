# Implementation Plan: Improve Post-Init Command Visibility

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Post-init command execution is opaque - users can't see what's happening during long-running commands
- **Domain Context**: Post-init commands like `pnpm i` can take minutes to complete, but run in background with no visible feedback
- **Current Behavior**: Command runs with `stdio: 'pipe'` and buffers all output until completion
- **User Experience Issue**: Users see "Workspace ready" then the command appears to hang with no feedback
- **Evidence**: Terminal shows completion but doesn't show post-init progress or completion status

## PLAN

- [ ] **EXAMINE CURRENT LOGGING**: Review how post-init commands are currently logged and executed
- [ ] **ADD PROGRESS INDICATORS**: Add real-time feedback showing post-init command is running
- [ ] **IMPROVE OUTPUT HANDLING**: Show post-init command output in real-time or provide progress updates
- [ ] **ADD COMPLETION FEEDBACK**: Clearly indicate when post-init commands complete successfully or fail
- [ ] **TEST VISIBILITY**: Verify that users can now see what's happening during post-init execution

## DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS

- None identified in this plan

## NOTES

- Need to balance real-time feedback with clean output
- Should maintain backward compatibility with existing post-init error handling
- Consider using progress indicators or streaming output for better UX
