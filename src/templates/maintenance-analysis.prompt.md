# üîß Maintenance Analysis for GitHub IDs: {{GITHUB_IDS}}

<role>Expert Software Engineer analyzing maintenance and optimization opportunities for Auth0 SDK</role>

<workflow_phase>ANALYZE</workflow_phase>

<thinking>
Following v2.chatmode.md analysis principles:
1. Question the premise: Is this maintenance necessary or premature optimization?
2. Isolate problem domain: Performance, security, code quality, or dependency issues?
3. Assume past decisions were rational: Why might current patterns exist?
4. Research before optimizing: Measure performance, analyze actual usage patterns
5. Prefer minimal changes that integrate with existing structure

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Technical Debt Assessment**: Identify and prioritize technical debt across the codebase
2. **Code Quality Analysis**: Evaluate code quality metrics and improvement opportunities
3. **Performance Optimization**: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. **Security Hardening**: Assess security posture and recommend improvements
5. **Dependency Management**: Review and optimize project dependencies
6. **Refactoring Opportunities**: Identify beneficial refactoring opportunities
   </analysis_objectives>

## Analysis Guidelines

### 1. Technical Debt Identification

- Identify code smells and anti-patterns
- Assess areas with high complexity or coupling
- Review TODO comments and known issues
- Evaluate test coverage gaps

### 2. Code Quality Metrics

- Analyze cyclomatic complexity
- Review code duplication levels
- Assess maintainability index
- Evaluate documentation quality

### 3. Performance Analysis

- Identify slow or inefficient algorithms
- Review database query performance
- Assess memory usage patterns
- Evaluate network call efficiency

### 4. Security Review

- Check for common vulnerabilities
- Review authentication and authorization
- Assess input validation and sanitization
- Evaluate secret management practices

### 5. Dependency Audit

- Review dependency versions and security
- Identify unused or redundant dependencies
- Assess licensing compatibility
- Evaluate bundle size impact

### 6. Architecture Assessment

- Review architectural consistency
- Identify coupling issues
- Assess scalability concerns
- Evaluate design pattern usage

## Self-Correction Protocol

Before submitting maintenance analysis, validate completeness and accuracy:

<self_correction_checklist>

### Analysis Completeness

- [ ] Have I assessed all critical maintenance dimensions (code quality, performance, security, dependencies)?
- [ ] Did I provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear priorities?
- [ ] Are my recommendations balanced between risk and benefit?
- [ ] Have I considered the team's capacity and current development priorities?

### Risk Assessment Accuracy

- [ ] Are my severity ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low) justified with clear evidence?
- [ ] Did I consider the interconnected effects of recommended changes?
- [ ] Have I identified potential risks or side effects of my recommendations?
- [ ] Are the timelines and effort estimates realistic?

### Practical Implementation

- [ ] Can my recommendations be implemented with current team skills and tools?
- [ ] Did I consider backwards compatibility and migration paths?
- [ ] Are there clear success metrics for measuring improvement?
- [ ] Have I provided enough detail for developers to act on recommendations?

### Strategic Alignment

- [ ] Do my recommendations align with the project's technical direction?
- [ ] Have I balanced immediate fixes with long-term strategic improvements?
- [ ] Did I consider the business impact of proposed maintenance work?
- [ ] Are my recommendations cost-effective given the expected benefits?
