Following structured development principles:
1. ANALYZE: Question the premise, understand the problem domain
2. DESIGN: Plan approach following existing patterns
3. IMPLEMENT: Small, testable increments
4. VALIDATE: Test behaviors and functionality
5. REFLECT: Lessons learned, identify improvements
6. HANDOFF: Clear documentation of changes and next steps

## Workflow Overview

This orchestrator coordinates the entire development workflow through structured phases:

### Phase 1: ANALYZE

- **Objective**: Understand the problem thoroughly
- **Key Activities**:
  - Question the feature premise
  - Map requirements and constraints
  - Identify affected components
  - Plan validation strategy
- **Artifacts**: Problem analysis, requirements specification
- **Success Criteria**: Clear understanding of what needs to be built and why

### Phase 2: DESIGN

- **Objective**: Plan the implementation approach
- **Key Activities**:
  - Design solution following existing patterns
  - Plan error handling and edge cases
  - Define testing strategy
  - Assess impact and dependencies
- **Artifacts**: Technical design, implementation plan
- **Success Criteria**: Clear roadmap for implementation

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENT

- **Objective**: Build the solution incrementally
- **Key Activities**:
  - Implement in small, testable chunks
  - Follow established coding patterns
  - Add comprehensive tests
  - Validate each increment
- **Artifacts**: Working code, test coverage
- **Success Criteria**: Functionality works as designed

### Phase 4: VALIDATE

- **Objective**: Ensure quality and completeness
- **Key Activities**:
  - Run comprehensive tests
  - Test edge cases and error conditions
  - Verify performance and security
  - Check integration points
- **Artifacts**: Test results, validation reports
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, requirements met

### Phase 5: REFLECT

- **Objective**: Learn and improve
- **Key Activities**:
  - Assess what worked well
  - Identify areas for improvement
  - Document lessons learned
  - Plan future enhancements
- **Artifacts**: Retrospective notes, improvement suggestions
- **Success Criteria**: Clear understanding of successes and areas for growth

### Phase 6: HANDOFF

- **Objective**: Enable others to use and maintain
- **Key Activities**:
  - Document changes and decisions
  - Create deployment/usage guides
  - Prepare handover materials
  - Define support procedures
- **Artifacts**: Documentation, runbooks, handover notes
- **Success Criteria**: Others can effectively use and maintain the solution

## Workflow Execution

### Prerequisites

1. Verify workspace is properly initialized
2. Confirm access to all required repositories
3. Validate development environment setup
4. Check that all dependencies are available

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd {{WORKSPACE_PATH}}

# Verify setup
./validate-environment        # Ensure all tools are available
./run-tests                  # Verify baseline functionality

# Follow the phase-based workflow
# Each phase should complete successfully before moving to the next
```

## Quality Gates

Each phase must meet specific criteria before proceeding:

### Phase Completion Criteria

- **ANALYZE**: Problem clearly understood, requirements documented
- **DESIGN**: Solution designed, implementation plan created
- **IMPLEMENT**: Code written, basic tests passing
- **VALIDATE**: All tests pass, requirements verified
- **REFLECT**: Lessons documented, improvements identified
- **HANDOFF**: Documentation complete, handover successful

### Failure Handling

If any phase fails:

1. **Document the failure** - What went wrong and why
2. **Assess impact** - Can we recover or need to restart?
3. **Plan remediation** - What steps will fix the issue
4. **Execute fix** - Implement the solution
5. **Validate fix** - Ensure the issue is resolved
6. **Continue workflow** - Resume from appropriate phase

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- All tests pass
- Code coverage meets requirements
- Performance benchmarks satisfied
- Security checks pass
- Documentation is complete

### Process Metrics

- Phase completion within planned timeframes
- Clear handoff with complete documentation
- Stakeholder satisfaction with deliverables
- Effective problem resolution

## Handoff

Upon completion, ensure:

- [ ] All code changes are committed and pushed
- [ ] Tests are passing in all environments
- [ ] Documentation is updated and accurate
- [ ] Deployment procedures are documented
- [ ] Support contact information is provided
- [ ] Known issues and limitations are documented

## Next Steps

Based on the workflow outcome:

- **Success**: Move to deployment or next iteration
- **Partial Success**: Document remaining work and plan completion
- **Failure**: Analyze root cause and plan recovery approach
