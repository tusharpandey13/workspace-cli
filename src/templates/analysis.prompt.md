<thinking>
Core analysis principles:
1. Question the premise: Is this the real problem or a symptom?
2. Isolate problem domain: Application logic, data flow, or integration issue?
3. Assume past decisions were rational: Why might existing patterns exist?
4. Research before implementing: Check documentation, established patterns, security implications
5. **Sample App First**: If sample app is available, prioritize reproduction before static analysis

## üîç Pre-Analysis Assessment (MANDATORY)

**STOP**: Before proceeding with analysis, you MUST evaluate these questions. If any answer is "No" or uncertain, consider declining analysis and providing guidance instead.

### Analysis Readiness Check

1. **Problem Definition**: Is the issue clearly defined with actionable scope?
   - ‚úÖ Clear symptoms and expected behavior described
   - ‚úÖ Reproducible steps or scenarios provided
   - ‚úÖ Impact and urgency are specified
   - ‚ùå If vague or requires significant clarification ‚Üí **REQUEST CLARIFICATION**

2. **Technical Prerequisites**: Do you have sufficient context to analyze effectively?
   - ‚úÖ Relevant code access and understanding of the tech stack
   - ‚úÖ CONTEXT.md contains necessary GitHub data and external context
   - ‚úÖ Sample app path and environment setup information available
   - ‚ùå If critical context is missing ‚Üí **REQUEST ADDITIONAL CONTEXT**

3. **Scope Appropriateness**: Is this issue suitable for technical analysis?
   - ‚úÖ Software engineering problem requiring code examination
   - ‚úÖ Within the bounds of the project/repository scope
   - ‚úÖ Not requiring external system access or credentials you don't have
   - ‚ùå If outside technical scope ‚Üí **RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVE APPROACH**

4. **Resource Availability**: Are necessary tools and information accessible?
   - ‚úÖ Sample app setup and environment configuration available
   - ‚úÖ Sufficient information to understand the problem domain
   - ‚úÖ No blocking dependencies on external systems or data
   - ‚ùå If critical resources unavailable ‚Üí **REQUEST RESOURCE ACCESS**

5. **Alternative Solutions**: Have simpler solutions been considered?
   - ‚úÖ Problem requires code-level investigation
   - ‚úÖ Not resolvable through configuration or user guidance
   - ‚úÖ Technical root cause analysis is the appropriate next step
   - ‚ùå If simpler solution exists ‚Üí **RECOMMEND SIMPLER APPROACH**

### Analysis Decision

**Based on the assessment above, should analysis proceed?**

- **‚úÖ PROCEED**: All prerequisites met, analysis is appropriate and feasible
- **‚ùå VETO**: Issue with prerequisites ‚Üí Provide specific guidance on what's needed

**If VETO**: Explain which prerequisites are not met and what steps should be taken instead of analysis.

## Technical Context & Patterns

### Preferred Solutions & Patterns

- **Defensive programming** - Validate all inputs and auth states
- **Immutable updates** - Avoid mutating objects directly
- **Proper error propagation** - Use structured error handling
- **Code quality** - Leverage best practices throughout
  </domain_knowledge>

## üß™ Sample App Reproduction Decision

**Evaluate**: Is sample app reproduction beneficial for this issue?

**Sample App Path**: {{SAMPLE_PATH}}

If sample app path is not "N/A" or empty, consider sample app reproduction:

### When to Use Sample App Reproduction:

- ‚úÖ User-facing bugs or behavior issues
- ‚úÖ Integration problems with external services
- ‚úÖ Authentication/authorization issues
- ‚úÖ Configuration or environment-related problems
- ‚úÖ UI/UX inconsistencies or errors

### When Static Analysis is Sufficient:

- ‚ùå Pure code quality/refactoring issues
- ‚ùå Internal API changes without user impact
- ‚ùå Build/tooling configuration issues
- ‚ùå Documentation-only changes

**Decision**: Choose your analysis approach below based on the issue type.

<analysis_workflow>

## Analysis Workflow (tick as you proceed)

### Option A: Sample App Reproduction First (Recommended for user-facing issues)

- [ ] **Setup Sample Environment**
  - Check sample app at: {{SAMPLE_PATH}}
  - Verify environment configuration (look for .env.local or similar)
  - Run setup commands: {{POST_INIT_COMMAND}}
  - Ensure dependencies are installed

- [ ] **Reproduce Issue**
  - Follow steps from GitHub issue/PR in `CONTEXT.md`
  - Document exact reproduction steps and results
  - Capture evidence (screenshots, logs, terminal output)

- [ ] **Validate Behavior**
  - Can you reproduce the issue? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
  - Does it match the reported behavior?
  - Any deviations or additional findings?

- [ ] **Analyze Source Code**
  - Review GitHub issue/PR details in `CONTEXT.md`
  - Examine source code structure and identify relevant files
  - Investigate root cause through code analysis with reproduction context

### Option B: Static Analysis Only (For internal/non-user-facing changes)

- [ ] Review GitHub issue/PR details in `CONTEXT.md`
- [ ] Examine source code structure and identify relevant files
- [ ] Analyze the reported problem and its symptoms
- [ ] Investigate root cause through code analysis

### Common Final Steps (Both Options)

- [ ] Consider existing patterns and architectural constraints
- [ ] Draft fix approach using established patterns
- [ ] Assess impact and compatibility considerations
- [ ] Document findings and next steps
