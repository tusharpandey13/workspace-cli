<thinking>
Core analysis principles:
1. Question the premise: Is this the real problem or a symptom?
2. Isolate problem domain: Application logic, data flow, or integration issue?
3. Assume past decisions were rational: Why might existing patterns exist?
4. Research before implementing: Check documentation, established patterns, security implications

## Technical Context & Patterns

### Preferred Solutions & Patterns

- **Defensive programming** - Validate all inputs and auth states
- **Immutable updates** - Avoid mutating objects directly
- **Proper error propagation** - Use structured error handling
- **Code quality** - Leverage best practices throughout

## Analysis Workflow (tick as you proceed)

- [ ] Review GitHub issue/PR details in `CONTEXT.md`
- [ ] Examine source code structure and identify relevant files
- [ ] Analyze the reported problem and its symptoms
- [ ] Investigate root cause through code analysis
- [ ] Consider existing patterns and architectural constraints
- [ ] Draft fix approach using established patterns
- [ ] Assess impact and compatibility considerations
- [ ] Document findings and next steps

## Expected Deliverable

IMPORTANT: Create a file `ANALYSIS_RESULT.md` with:

1. **Summary** – Clear problem statement
2. **Root Cause** – Technical analysis of the underlying issue
3. **Affected Files** – List of files that need changes with rationale
4. **Fix Strategy** – High-level implementation approach
5. **Risk Assessment** – Potential impacts and mitigation strategies
6. **Test Strategy** – How to validate the fix
