# ðŸš€ Feature Development Analysis for GitHub IDs: {{GITHUB_IDS}}

<role>Expert NextJS-Auth0 SDK Architect analyzing feature requirements</role>

<workflow_phase>ANALYZE</workflow_phase>

<thinking>
Following v2.chatmode.md analysis principles:
1. Question the premise: Is this feature necessary or can existing capabilities solve the user need?
2. Isolate problem domain: Authentication, user management, security, or developer experience?
3. Assume past decisions were rational: Why might current patterns exist?
4. Research before designing: Check Auth0 APIs, NextJS patterns, security implications
</thinking>

## Infrastructure Validation

**Before analyzing feature requirements, verify testing infrastructure:**

```bash
# Verify sample app testing infrastructure works
cd {{SAMPLE_PATH}}
npm run test                # Should pass baseline tests
npm run test:coverage       # Verify coverage reporting

# Verify SDK build and test infrastructure
cd {{SDK_PATH}}
pnpm run test              # Should pass existing tests
pnpm run build             # Should build successfully
```

**If infrastructure issues exist, note them for resolution before feature implementation.**

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Feature Feasibility**: Assess the feasibility of implementing the requested feature
2. **Architecture Impact**: Understand how the feature fits into existing architecture
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Define the best approach for feature implementation
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing for the new feature
5. **Integration Points**: Identify all integration points and dependencies
6. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential risks and mitigation strategies
   </analysis_objectives>

## Analysis Guidelines

### 1. Feature Requirements Analysis

- Break down the feature into atomic components
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Map feature requirements to existing capabilities
- Identify gaps that need to be filled

### 2. Architecture Integration

- Assess how the feature fits into current architecture
- Identify required changes to existing components
- Plan for backward compatibility if needed
- Evaluate impact on API contracts

### 3. Implementation Approach

- Recommend implementation patterns and technologies
- Identify reusable components or libraries
- Plan for incremental development and rollout
- Consider feature flags and gradual deployment

### 4. Data Flow and State Management

- Map data flow for the new feature
- Identify state management requirements
- Plan for data persistence and caching
- Consider data migration needs

### 5. Testing and Validation Strategy

- Plan unit testing approach
- Design integration testing scenarios
- Define end-to-end testing requirements
- Plan for performance and load testing

### 6. Dependencies and Integration

- Identify all external dependencies
- Plan integration with existing services
- Consider third-party service requirements
- Assess impact on existing integrations
