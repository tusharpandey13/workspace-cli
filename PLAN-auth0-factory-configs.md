# Implementation Plan: Auth0 Factory Configurations

## ANALYZE

- **Problem**: Users need zero-config Auth0 SDK development setup
- **Affected Files**: `config.yaml`, new test files, e2e tests
- **Risks**: Repository availability, dependency management, build failures
- **Approach**: Test Driven Development - write tests first, then implement

## TDD PLAN (E2E-First Approach)

### Phase 1: E2E Test Framework Setup

- [ ] Create `e2e/test-auth0-factory-configs.sh` - Main E2E test runner for Auth0 configs
- [ ] Create `e2e/auth0-helpers.sh` - Helper functions for Auth0-specific testing
- [ ] Add Auth0 test scenarios to `e2e/test-matrix.md`
- [ ] Setup isolated test environments with cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Add timeout and safety protections for repository operations

### Phase 2: E2E Tests for Repository Accessibility (Failing Tests First)

- [ ] Write E2E test: Verify all 14 Auth0 repositories are accessible via git clone
- [ ] Write E2E test: Verify all Auth0 sample repositories are accessible
- [ ] Write E2E test: Check repository structure matches expected patterns
- [ ] Write E2E test: Validate repository has expected build files (package.json, pom.xml, etc.)
- [ ] Run tests - EXPECT ALL TO FAIL (no configs exist yet)

### Phase 3: Repository Research & Analysis (Make Tests Pass)

- [ ] Research `auth0/node-auth0` - Management API SDK structure
- [ ] Research `auth0/nextjs-auth0` - Next.js SDK and samples
- [ ] Research `auth0/auth0-spa-js` - SPA SDK structure
- [ ] Research `auth0/auth0-java` - Java SDK and build systems
- [ ] Research `auth0/express-openid-connect` - Express middleware
- [ ] Research `auth0/auth0-angular` - Angular SDK
- [ ] Research `auth0/auth0-vue` - Vue.js SDK
- [ ] Research `auth0/auth0-react` - React SDK
- [ ] Research `auth0/lock` - Legacy UI widget
- [ ] Research `auth0/terraform-provider-auth0` - Terraform provider
- [ ] Research `auth0/react-native-auth0` - Mobile SDK
- [ ] Research `auth0/wordpress` - WordPress plugin
- [ ] Research `auth0/java-jwt` - JWT library
- [ ] Research `auth0/jwks-rsa-java` - JWKS library
- [ ] Document findings for each repository's structure and requirements

### Phase 4: E2E Tests for Basic CLI Integration (Failing Tests First)

- [ ] Write E2E test: `space init node-auth0` should clone both main and sample repos
- [ ] Write E2E test: `space init nextjs-auth0` should setup Next.js environment
- [ ] Write E2E test: `space init auth0-spa` should setup SPA environment
- [ ] Write E2E test: `space init auth0-java` should work with both Gradle and Maven
- [ ] Write E2E test: All Auth0 configs should create proper worktree structure
- [ ] Run tests - EXPECT ALL TO FAIL (no configurations exist yet)

### Phase 5: Minimal Configuration Implementation (Make Basic Tests Pass)

- [ ] Research and implement basic `config.yaml` entries for all 14 Auth0 repos
- [ ] Add repository URLs (main and sample) for each Auth0 project
- [ ] Create minimal post-init commands (just dependency installation)
- [ ] Add basic environment file templates to `env-files/`
- [ ] Run E2E tests - EXPECT BASIC CLONING TO PASS

### Phase 6: E2E Tests for Post-Init Commands (Failing Tests First)

- [ ] Write E2E test: Post-init should install Node.js dependencies for JS/TS projects
- [ ] Write E2E test: Post-init should run Gradle/Maven builds for Java projects
- [ ] Write E2E test: Post-init should verify prerequisites (Node, Java, Go, PHP versions)
- [ ] Write E2E test: Post-init should handle missing prerequisites gracefully
- [ ] Write E2E test: Environment files should be created and populated
- [ ] Run tests - EXPECT ALL TO FAIL (minimal post-init commands)

### Phase 7: Enhanced Post-Init Implementation (Make Tests Pass)

- [ ] Add prerequisite checking to post-init commands
- [ ] Add proper dependency installation for each tech stack
- [ ] Add framework-specific setup (Angular CLI, Vue CLI, etc.)
- [ ] Add error handling and rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Run E2E tests - EXPECT POST-INIT TESTS TO PASS

### Phase 8: E2E Tests for Sample App Functionality (Failing Tests First)

- [ ] Write E2E test: Sample apps should build successfully after setup
- [ ] Write E2E test: Sample apps should start/run where applicable
- [ ] Write E2E test: Environment variables should be properly configured
- [ ] Write E2E test: Sample apps should have working Auth0 integration stubs
- [ ] Run tests - EXPECT ALL TO FAIL (basic setup only)

### Phase 9: Final Implementation (Make All Tests Pass)

- [ ] Enhance configurations for full sample app functionality
- [ ] Add sample app build verification to post-init
- [ ] Add environment variable validation
- [ ] Add sample app startup verification where possible
- [ ] Run all E2E tests - EXPECT 95%+ PASS RATE

### Phase 10: Unit Tests for Coverage (After E2E Tests Pass)

- [ ] Create `test/auth0-factory-configs.test.ts` - Unit tests for config validation
- [ ] Test configuration structure and field validation
- [ ] Test post-init command generation and validation
- [ ] Test environment template formatting
- [ ] Unit tests should achieve >95% coverage of Auth0-specific code

### Phase 11: Documentation & Cleanup

- [ ] Update README with Auth0 factory configuration examples
- [ ] Document prerequisite requirements for each Auth0 SDK
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common Auth0 setup issues
- [ ] Document E2E test results and performance metrics
- [ ] **[LOW PRIORITY]** Run `pnpm run lint:fix` on all modified files

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All 14 Auth0 configurations work with `space init <auth0-project>`
- Sample applications clone and build successfully
- Prerequisites are properly validated
- E2E tests have >95% pass rate
- Zero-config experience for Auth0 DX team developers

## TDD TESTING STRATEGY (E2E First)

1. **E2E Tests (Primary)**: Full workflow from repository accessibility to working sample apps
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Write failing E2E tests, then implement features to make them pass
3. **Safety Mechanisms**: Isolated test environments, timeouts, cleanup procedures
4. **Unit Tests (Secondary)**: Configuration validation and edge cases after E2E tests pass
5. **Manual Validation**: Final developer workflow verification

## RISK MITIGATION

- Repository availability checking before configuration creation
- Graceful handling of missing prerequisites with clear error messages
- Timeout mechanisms for long-running setup operations
- Rollback capabilities for failed setups
